## Abstract

This paper investigates a safety-critical control problem for a mobile robot navigating cluttered environments.  
Obstacles are represented as a closed set, and a direction-distance function is used to model the obstacle measurement process.  

Based on real-time obstacle measurements, a safety-critical controller is expected to:

- maintain a safe distance between the robot and obstacles, and  
- ensure that the robot‚Äôs velocity, considered as the control input, follows a given velocity command signal as closely as possible.  

This paper contributes:

- a regularization method for the obstacle-measurement model in the body-fixed frame, and  
- a systematic design of a Lipschitz continuous safety-critical controller based on the regularized obstacle-measurement model and quadratic programming (QP).  

Specifically:

- a novel Lipschitz-truncated regularization term is used to replace the conventional quadratic regularization in Moreau-Yosida regularization;  
- it is guaranteed that, for each local minimum distance given by the original direction-distance function and its corresponding direction, there exists a neighborhood around that direction where the value of the regularized direction-distance function does not exceed the local minimum distance.  

This property is crucial for constructing a feasible set of control input that ensures safety in all directions using only a finite number of constraints. 
The QP framework is then employed to integrate these safety constraints with nominal velocity commands.  
A specific positive basis is employed to meet the linear independence constraint qualification, ensuring the Lipschitz continuity of the QP-based safety-critical controller.  

The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated through numerical simulations and physical experiments.
